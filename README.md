# Artemis Financial Project

## Artifact Summary  
**Artemis Financial** is a financial services company that needed help securing its software with encryption and secure communication.

## Reflection Questions  

1. **Client and Software Requirements**  
   Artemis Financial needed encryption, secure communications, and testing to protect sensitive data.

2. **What Was Done Well**  
   I implemented AES encryption, added a checksum, and set up HTTPS. Secure coding prevents data breaches and builds trust.

3. **Challenges and Insights**  
   Setting up HTTPS and debugging encryption was tricky but improved my understanding of security tools.

4. **Increasing Layers of Security**  
   I used AES encryption, HTTPS, and checksum verification. In the future, Iâ€™d use automated security scans.

5. **Ensuring Functionality and Security**  
   I tested the app to make sure AES, HTTPS, and the checksum worked without issues.

6. **Resources and Tools**  
   I used AES encryption, SHA-256 checksums, HTTPS, and testing tools for security.

7. **Future Employer Value**  
   This project shows I can secure data, follow best practices, and ensure functionality.
